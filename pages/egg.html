				As you move through the world collecting items from PokéStops, you might just luck out and pick up an Poké Egg. These eggs will eventually become Pokémon in their own right, but they need a little bit of incubation — and a lot of steps — to make that happen. <br />
				<br />
				When you pick up an egg, you need to place it in an incubator to get the hatching process going. You start the game with a single, unlimited-use incubator, but you can purchase more if you want to hatch several eggs at once. <br />
				<br />
				Once the egg is incubated, you'll need to physically walk — sorry, would-be cheats, but driving won't work — a certain distance before the egg will hatch. Depending on the rarity of the Poké Egg you've found, that could be as little as 2 kilometers, or up to 10 kilometers. And yes, you will have to walk with the app open for those steps to register. RIP battery life. <br />
				<br />
				Silph Road discovered that you can't move more than 10.5 km/h for Pokémon Go to register your movement. Any faster and it will flag you as driving (or riding a bicycle too fast). The game also determines your movement by logging your steps from point A to point B and then calculating the distance, so you can't put your device on a record player or tape it to a ceiling fan. <br />
