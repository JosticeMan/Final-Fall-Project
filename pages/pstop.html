				PokéStops are important or iconic places around your area: They may be special benches with dedication plaques, permanent art installations, or historic landmarks. They'll never be something as mundane as a stop sign, nor will they be in a location that is not accessible to the public — like something inside a private building, or beyond a locked gate. <br />
				<br />
				PokéStops are an easy way to collect items, experience, and Poké Eggs (which hatch into Pokémon with the help of incubators, which we'll talk about later).
				<br />
				They're indicated on your map by tall poles with blue cube atop them: You can tap one even if you're not in range to find out which landmark they're associated with, but you won't be able to check in until you're close to the PokéStop. <br />
				<br />
				When a PokéStop is within range, the blue cube will transform into a spinning disc, which you can tap on to visit. Inside, you'll see the PokéStop symbol with a disc in the middle that displays the location's photo; you may also get some historical information about the monument, if you're into that sort of thing.<br />
				<br />
				Swipe the disc to spin it, and you'll be rewarded with a variety of items. Items can include Poké Eggs, Poké Balls, healing potions, and more. As you increase in levels, you unlock new items to collect. <br />
				<br />
				After you visit a PokéStop, the blue pole will change to purple, and you'll be unable to visit for at least 10 minutes. <br />

				Items are a must-have in this game: You need Poké Balls to capture Pokémon, Incense to lure them, and potions and revives to heal them after Gym battles. <br />
				<br />
				Like many games of this era, you can purchase many of these items with real-world currency as transformed into PokéCoins — but you don't have to. You can stock up on most items just by visiting PokéStops. (About the only things you can't find at stops are the Bag and Pokémon Storage upgrade.) <br />
				<br />
				You never know what you're going to come across at a PokéStop, but it's almost always helpful. Each item has a specific use in the game; most fall into either the "capture" or "recovery" category, helping you capture new Pokémon or aiding your current Pokémon in healing after Gym battles. <br />
				<br />
				You can also find incense, which lures Pokémon to you; Lucky Eggs, which grant you double experience for 30 minutes; Lure Patches, which draw Pokémon to a PokéStop; Razz Berries, which make it easier to catch more of the same species of Pokémon; and Poké Eggs, which can hatch into new Pokémon. <br />
