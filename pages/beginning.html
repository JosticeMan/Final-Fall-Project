				Before you dive in to Pokémon Go, you'll want to get the hang of how the game works. That means knowing the world, its mechanics, and how to access your Pokédex, Items, and more. <br />
				<br />
				To sign up for the game, you'll need to use your Google account or sign up for a Pokémon Trainer Club account. Pokémon Go stores all your information on its servers, so you'll need to use one of these two methods to link your Pokémon data to your device. <br />
				<br />
				<a target="_blank" href = "http://www.imore.com/how-to-sign-up-for-pokemon-go"> <b> How to sign up for Pokémon Go </b> </a> <br />
				After signing up, you'll want to customize your digital avatar. You can choose your gender, eye color, hair color, shirt, hat, pants, shoes, and the style of your backpack. Don't worry about it too much: If you change your mind later, you can go back and re-customize it. <br />
				<br />
				<a target="_blank" href = "http://www.imore.com/how-re-customize-your-pokemon-go-trainer"> <b> How to re-customize your Pokémon Go trainer </b> </a> <br />
				Once you've done so, you'll enter the main area of the game: The Pokémon Go map. <br />
				<br />
				Essentially, the main area of the game is a brightly-animated version of Google Maps. You'll see (unmarked) roads, rustling grass (marking Pokémon in the area), and local landmarks disguised as PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms. As you move in the real world, your avatar does too. Pokémon will pop up on the map with a small vibration as you walk along, and if you tap on them, you can try to capture them. <br />
				<br />
				<b> Player icon </b> : Your player icon is at the bottom left corner of the screen. Tap on this to view your character's information, as well as a list of in-game achievements. <br />
				<b> Backpack </b>: This is where all the items you pick up on your journey are stored. <br />
				<b> Pokédex </b>: Your index of Pokémon, complete with information on all the species you've already caught. <br />
				<b> Pokémon </b> : Here, you can see all the Pokémon that are in your possession. <br />
				<b> Sightings Screen </b>: Tap on the grey box in the bottom right corner of the screen to see <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.imore.com/how-track-and-find-nearby-pokemon-in-pokemon-go"> which Pokémon are nearby. </a> <br />

				Whether you've never caught a Pokémon before or you've been collecting these creatures since childhood, you'll quickly get introduced to the Pokémon of this world after starting the game. (Heck, the very first screen you see after logging in is of a giant Gyarados menacing an unaware player, as a warning to stay alert while playing.) <br />
				<br />
				At the start, you'll only be able to catch Nintendo's original lineup of Pokémon — those found in the Red, Blue, and Yellow titles — though we expect expansions to appear as the game grows and works out the bugs. <br />
				<br />
				Pokémon come in variety of types, shapes, and sizes: Of the over 100 Pokémon available for capture, you'll find creatures of the Fairy, Psychic, Electric, Grass, Water, Ghost, Bug, Rock, Ground, Poison, Flying, and Normal type. We haven't spotted any Legendary Pokémon quite yet, but that doesn't mean they aren't out there hiding. <br />
				<br />
				<a target="_blank" href = "http://www.imore.com/where-to-find-different-types-of-pokemon-in-pokemon-go"> <b> Where to find different types of Pokémon </b> </a> <br />
				Each geographical area has a specific Pokémon type, and some creatures are more difficult to find than others. If you keep running into the same group of Pidgey and Caterpie, don't lose hope: You need to travel around your area to find all the Pokémon. You can head to local lakes, ponds, or beaches to find Water-type Pokémon, for example, or wait until the evening to have a better chance at grabbing a Fairy type. <br />
				<br />
				It isn't a bad thing to catch a lot of the same type of Pokémon. You'll soon learn that there are a whole lot of Pidgey and Rattata. You'll earn what's called a "Catch Bonus" for catching more of a specific type of Pokémon. So, don't feel bad if you have 50 Pidgey in your Pokédex. Those things are good for something, after all. <br />

				As with all Pokémon games, when a trainer begins their first journey, they're given a choice of which Pokémon to start with. After you've finished customizing your avatar, three Pokémon will appear in front of you. You can choose from Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle; after capturing one, the other two will disappear. <br />
				<br />
				<b> But wait: There's more. If you walk away from the original three Pokémon four times, you'll get a fourth starter Pokémon option: Pikachu. </b> <br />
				<br />
				Simply tap on the pokemon upon moving closer to it by walking towards it in real life. <br />

				Once you've gotten started with the game and captured your first Pokémon, it's time to go hunting for some others. <br />
				<br />

				<a target="_blank" href = "http://www.imore.com/where-to-find-different-types-of-pokemon-in-pokemon-go"> <b> Where to find rare Pokémon </b> </a> <br />
				You can find wild Pokémon by physically walking around your area. Stick to populated areas: Pokémon appear most often near PokéStops. The more PokéStops nearby, the more creatures should appear. Try visiting locations with a lot of public art; tourist spots or malls are great starting points. <br />
				<br />
				As you walk around in the real world, your avatar moves along the map using GPS. When a Pokémon is close enough to capture, it pops up on your screen. Since walking around with your eyes glued to your phone is a bit of a safety hazard, the game is designed to allow you to keep your eyes free while you wander. You can keep your phone at your side while you walk; when you are near a Pokémon, you'll get a notification in the form of a vibration and (if your sound is turned on) the Pokémon's unique call. <br />
				<br />
				You can then move to a safe location (if you were walking along a road, for instance), and tap the visible Pokémon to capture it. Tapping zooms in on your avatar and launches an augmented reality experience with the Pokémon dancing around amidst your surroundings. If you don't see it on the screen immediately in front of you, move your device around until it appears. (There are arrows on the side of the screen to guide you in the right direction.) <br />
				<br />
				If AR makes you nauseous or you don't want your battery drained, you can always turn the feature off in the upper right corner. <br />
				<br />
				Once you've found the Pokémon, it's time to throw a Poké Ball to try and capture it. You "throw" in game by tapping and holding on your Poké Ball; a glowing, shrinking ring appears then around the Pokémon. When the ring gets to its smallest, you want to flick your Poké Ball directly toward the creature (with the aim of bopping it on the head) and release your finger; if successful, you'll capture the Pokémon inside. <br />
				<br />
				<a target="_blank" href = "http://www.imore.com/how-to-catch-pokemon-and-rare-pokemon"> <b> How to catch Pokémon with bonuses </b> </a> <br />
				<a target="_blank" href = "http://www.imore.com/how-to-throw-curveball-pokemon-go"> <b> How to throw a perfect curveball in Pokémon Go </b> </a> <br />
				Not all Pokémon enjoy being inside itty bitty areas, however, and some may jump out of your Poké Ball after one or two shakes. If this happens, you'll want to throw another Poké Ball to try and recapture it — or, if you're running low on supplies, run away. <br />
				<br />
				As you progress in the game, you'll encounter stronger Pokémon that require a more powerful Poké Ball (or Razz Berries, which lull the Pokémon to complacency). If the ring surrounding the Pokémon is green, you should have no problem capturing it; if it's yellow, you have a fifty-fifty chance; when you see a red ring, you'll need to use multiple Poké Balls, more powerful Poké Balls, or Razz Berries to have a remote chance of catching it. <br />
				<br />
				More than one player can catch the same Pokémon; if you and your friend see the same Pokémon on the street, you can both grab it for your separate collections. <br />
				<br />
				You can also use special items to attract Pokémon to your location: You can use incense to lure Pokémon to you personally for 30 minutes, or — if you're at a PokéStop — use a Lure Module. This will bring Pokémon to the stop; every player there can catch them for the next 15 minutes. <br />
